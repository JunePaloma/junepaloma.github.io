      <p> An objective I’m always striving towards is to “play it as it lays.” No cheating. No rearranging information to suit my favored version of reality. The challenge to abiding by this principle in most areas of life is a lack of reliable feedback to indicate when I’ve deviated from the cold hard facts and started imposing my own narrative.<br> The magic of Test Driven Development is that it provides exactly that kind of feedback for the code I’m endeavoring to write. Testing provides a mechanism for deducing where my narrative has deviated from the reality of the code I’m writing.
